            <h1>まふまふ / mafumafu</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Mafumafu（まふまふ） is an utaite (song cover artist) who started his activities in December of 2010. In addition to his cover work, he is an active composer and VOCALOID producer, with a distinctively large vocal range (upwards of four octaves). His self-written lyrics often touch upon themes of depression, religion, loneliness, and unrequited love: something his listeners deeply relate to, with some even claiming to have been "saved" by his music. Other songs are more uplifting or even flat-out silly, with topics usually about cats.
            <br><br>
            Due to his impressive vocal range, he is able to produce a very convincing feminine voice, dubbed "Mafuko" at first (now "Manun-chan"). This is most obvious when one listens to certain self-duet covers of his, such as Matryoshka, or Turing Love.
            </p>
            <h1>Collaboration Partners and Units</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Mafumafu is a member of many utaite groups ("units"), most notably <a href="profile2.html">After the Rain</a> (AtR), in which he collaborates with another well-known utaite and longtime friend, Soraru. In addition to the aforesaid, he is a member of SoraMafuUraSaka (SMUS), again with Soraru, and the two utaite Uratanuki and Tonari no Sakata. SMUS music mainly follows video game motifs, whilst AtR songs cover a diverse range of topics, allowing the unique abilities of its two members to shine best.
            <br><br>
            He also collaborates with his other friends from time to time, most frequently Amatsuki, although these units do not have formal titles; like SMUS, they are often mashups of names.
            </p>
            <h1>Other Names</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>"Mafumafu" has been his name ever since he started his online activities, although he sometimes uses the self-given nickname "Nandemoya-san" (meaning a jack-of-all-trades), or the joke producer name "Kagami Mite Shisshin-P" ("looked in the mirror and swooned-P). He has, on occasion, released music with vocals accredited to Manun-chan; however, as aforesaid, that is merely the name of his female persona.
            <br><br>
            Although Mafumafu occasionally produces music under different names, he asks for his listeners not to disclose what they are, if stumbled upon.
            </p>
            <h1>Avatar</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Mafumafu’s digital avatar is a distinctive albino-like character with short white hair and medium-length bangs. It has red eyes and a barcode upon its left cheek, which one can scan to “transport” the real Mafumafu into the digital world (this is also the reason for the “noise” particles adorning his latest Live2D model).
            <br><br>
            He is oftentimes drawn with cat ears and a tail, and such ears were included with his Nendoroid figure as optional accessories. In addition to the aforesaid, his LINE stamps (drawn by Chachagoma) and all released plushies include them as well, excluding those of “Dark Mafu”, and Manun-chan.
            <br><br>
            “Dark Mafu” is Mafumafu’s chuunibyou persona, characterized with black hair instead of white, and blue eyes instead of red. There are two released prize toy plushies of Dark Mafu, with the design also featured within the aforementioned LINE stamp sets.
            <br><br>
            Mafumafu is also usually drawn as a (sometimes fallen) angel in his album artwork or MVs, which most likely serves as an allusion to the aforementioned religious themes.
